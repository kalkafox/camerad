A script that uses ffmpeg to convert RTSP stream into jpeg/png. Basically what it is.

The node.js script is included with a php file for the webserver to view the converted image.

NOTE: This requires a node.js dependency: image-plucker (so npm install image-plucker).
This also requires ffmpeg.

I did not make this script! All credits go to FÃ©lix Wolf.
